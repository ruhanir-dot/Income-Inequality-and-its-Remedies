# Income-Inequality-and-its-Remedies
Our project examines the relationship between global income inequality and political stability (FSI), corruption (CPI), and educational inequality. 
Within this project we use methods such as EDA, data transformation, Multiple linear regression and model selection. Our results are intended to direct initiatives to address the main causes of income inequality.
